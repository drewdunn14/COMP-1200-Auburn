Directions/Help for set-up:

The main file is Exam02StudyGuide, since Exams are comprehensive there is a good bit of stuff from exam01/02 on there.
With that being said, there are a few things to do to make sure everything runs correctly. 

If it automatically adds a number within brackets to the filename like it would by opening a file from email,
it is usually automatically added to an attachments folder, find it in this folder and remove the brackets
from each filename (rename) to be able to save it under a valid name and in the preferred directory.

File Directory – MainStudyGuide.m contains two simple user-defined functions,
which are contained in the files cubedExample.m & wilks.m
make sure these three files are saved in the same folder together or the main file will not be able to access the files
that the functions are held in. The file StudyGuideText.txt should also be saved in the same folder as it is used in a scanning
function within the MainStudyGuide.m

Within the User-Defined Functions Functions Example Folder:
There is a worked and explained example of one of the user defined function from canvas,
quad_eq_funct.m is a parent file to the following three files: getCoefs.m & compRoots.m & printResults.m 
Make sure these four files are saved in the same folder so that the parent file will be able to access the functions.

MainStudyGuide.m – everything is suppressed as default or commented out to keep the command window clean.
To see the results to conditionals, graphs, print statements, variables, etc. just unsuppress (remove the ;)
or remove the comment from whatever it is you would like to see  appear in the command window.

Other than that let me know if something isn’t working or if you guys find a mistake. Auburn email is available on COMP-1200 home page
as well as header of MainStudyGuide.m
